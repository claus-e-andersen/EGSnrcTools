# This script if for bash / linux.

# Objective: To run a sensitivity analysis using EGSnrc.
# The code is targeted for analysis for  a multi-core environment.

# Procedure: 
# 1. Create a template egsinp file where the parameters to be studied
# are marked as, for example, xxMeV and xxHistories.

# 2. Modify the script such as to loop over the parameter space
# of interest (for example, testing different energies as done
# below using xxMeV equal to 0.5, 0.6 etc.).

# 2. Produce new egsinp files using the naming scheme that includes
# a sequential run number (for example, 1100, 1101, 1101 etc.).
# The start number can be defined using the variable called "start").


# This is an improved sensitivity script that includes:
#  1. Creation of a junk-folder
#  2. Movement of all files with w1 or w 22 etc in their names (such
#     files are normally from multi core runs).
#  3. Extraction of output from the lst-file (i.e. the main EGSnrc output)
#     and output to the sensitivity log-file.
#  4. Improved naming, where the extension of egsinp and egslst files
#     are now hardwired into the code (and not included in the postfix as
#     done previously).
